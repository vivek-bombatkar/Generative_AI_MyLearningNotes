      "\n",
      "As a high school student, choosing the right programming language to learn can be exciting and overwhelming at the same time. All three options you mentioned, Python, JavaScript, and Fortran, have their strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice for you depends on your interests and goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Here's a breakdown of each language and what it's best suited for:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Python:**\n",
      "    * **Strengths:** \n",
      "        * **Easy to learn:** Python has a simple and readable syntax, making it a great choice for beginners.\n",
      "        * **Versatile:** Python can be used for a wide range of tasks, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and scripting.\n",
      "        * **Large community:** Python has a huge and active community, which means there are plenty of resources available to help you learn and solve problems.\n",
      "    * **Weaknesses:**\n",
      "        * **Slower than compiled languages:** Python is an interpreted language, which means it can be slower than compiled languages like C++ or Java.\n",
      "        * **Not ideal for low-level programming:** Python is not well-suited for tasks that require direct hardware access, such as embedded systems programming.\n",
      "* **JavaScript:**\n",
      "    * **Strengths:**\n",
      "        * **Essential for web development:** JavaScript is the primary language used for adding interactivity to websites.\n",
      "        * **Widely used:** JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world, so learning it opens up a wide range of career opportunities.\n",
      "        * **Relatively easy to learn:** While JavaScript has a steeper learning curve than Python, it's still considered a beginner-friendly language.\n",
      "    * **Weaknesses:**\n",
      "        * **Can be complex for beginners:** JavaScript has some quirks and complexities that can be challenging for new programmers.\n",
      "        * **Not as versatile as Python:** JavaScript is primarily used for web development, and while it can be used for other tasks, it's not as versatile as Python.\n",
      "* **Fortran:**\n",
      "    * **Strengths:**\n",
      "        * **High performance:** Fortran is a compiled language, which means it can be very fast.\n",
      "        * **Well-suited for scientific computing:** Fortran is widely used in scientific and engineering fields due to its speed and numerical accuracy.\n",
      "    * **Weaknesses:**\n",
      "        * **Difficult to learn:** Fortran has a complex syntax and requires a strong understanding of computer science concepts.\n",
      "        * **Limited career opportunities:** While Fortran is still used in some industries, it's not as widely used as Python or JavaScript, which can limit career opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Making your decision\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on your information, here are some factors to consider when making your decision:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Your interests:**\n",
      "    * **Are you interested in web development?** If so, JavaScript is the best choice.\n",
      "    * **Do you want to learn a general-purpose language that can be used for a variety of tasks?** If so, Python is a good option.\n",
      "    * **Are you interested in scientific computing?** If so, Fortran is the best choice.\n",
      "* **Your learning style:**\n",
      "    * **Do you prefer a language with a simple and easy-to-read syntax?** If so, Python is a good choice.\n",
      "    * **Are you comfortable with a more challenging language?** If so, JavaScript or Fortran might be a better fit.\n",
      "* **Your career goals:**\n",
      "    * **What kind of job are you interested in?** Research the programming languages that are in demand for your desired career path.\n",
      "\n",
      "## My recommendation\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on your current information, I recommend starting with either Python or JavaScript.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Python:** If you're new to programming and want to learn a versatile language with a large community, Python is a great choice. You can use it for web development, data analysis, machine learning, and much more.\n",
      "* **JavaScript:** If you're interested in web development and want to learn a widely used language with plenty of career opportunities, JavaScript is a good option. \n",
      "\n",
