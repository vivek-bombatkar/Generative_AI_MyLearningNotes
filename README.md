TODO:
Prompt Prefixes: Add a prefix like "As a knowledgeable advisor:" before the prompt to steer the model's response style.

Prompt Decomposition: Break down the prompt into sub-prompts like "What are typical extracurricular activities for high school students?" and "What factors should be considered when recommending an activity to a student?"

Prompt Reframing: Rephrase the prompt to be more specific, e.g. "Recommend an extracurricular activity suitable for a high school student based on their interests and schedule availability."

Prompt Constraints: Add constraints like "Suggest an activity that is low-cost and doesn't require travel" to narrow down the response.

Prompt Mirroring: Ask the model to first rephrase or summarize the prompt to check its understanding before providing a suggestion.
